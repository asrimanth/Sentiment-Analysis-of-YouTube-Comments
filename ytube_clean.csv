Listen, dude, you're all over the place. You really need to focus better. Now, if you're talking about a simulation wouldn't the logical conclusion to such a video be to propose or write programs that could prove it and not talk about the ""simulated diseases along with us simulated humans"". Anyway, with this video you have proven nothing, it's just a bunch of hypothesis you took from elsewhere. I will just reiterate what I wrote while watching this video: 1) 3:17 Videogames getting better is an insufficient argument. Video games through machine learning which is using our own systems of understanding the world through our eyes if making the world look alike on the monitor to the one we see. That doesn't mean a simulation of reality is possible. Do you even realize how much computational power would have to be used to simulate every proton, electron, neutron of every atom in every molecule just so a teenager could look at her loserbook page and comment 'cool pie you're eating' which has no scientific relevance to anyone running the simulation whatsoever. It's just stupid to even think this is not reality. What point would everything have. Also, if it's a simulation it's bound to have bugs but the only bugs that exist are in brains, reality doesn't change, we forget things. Therefore you're projecting your imperfections onto the space around you by saying this is a simulation. It's not, the universe in your head is a simulation you made up. 2) 6:05 While this is interesting it doesn't mean a human watching and once you think about it, it makes perfect logical sense and it's a regular physics thing, just like a Doppler effect. It means that the quanta are so sensible to interference that when measuring them you emit so much energy that it impacts the system and you see a different result. Doesn't have a thing to do with this being a simulation. 3) 6:54 That was one of the stupidest and cringiest things I've ever seen, wtf was the point of that?

My work isn't ""garbage"" because I am paid for it, or because you can't examine my code (not that any of you do), and FOSS is not superior because it is free. When a bug turns up in a proprietary program, it has to be fixed, and it has to be fixed NOW. If a bug turns up in a FOSS program, oh well. Maybe you'll be lucky and it will be fixed in the next release. Or maybe the bug will remain unfixed for years despite repeated reports and requests from users. Try running a business that way. This ""holier than thou"" attitude is bullshit. I run MS Office in a Windows VM under Linux. I have certain documents set up to print a certain way. If I open those documents in Libre Office and print them, they do not look the same. The positioning is off. That's a problem.

I have been using Manjaro and I really dislike WPS office. Libre office isn't much better in my opinion. I know some people will burn this post to the ground but in my opinion, if there was an office suite that was open source that was just like Microsoft office but didn't have the Microsoft name, people would use it by choice. I think some people are just anti-Microsoft and hate anything that shares any qualities of a Windows product. I get that. However, if something like this Free Office is available and it's very close to what I am used to, I'm going to give it a look. I mean are you going to be more productive on something you know or take the time to learn the nuances of something new with a big learning curve? Me, I don't like wasting my time.

However, I do think some aspects of the Talk were in need of further development or were a little misleading.. When she talks about inequality, for example, I think it's always important to remeber the big historical picture of slavery, colonialism, imperialism, savage capitalism, institutional racism, etc, which enables us to understand the inequalities between countries, that is to say: ""first-world"" countries, the imperialists, exploring and marginalizing the rest of the world, creating social spaces deprived from resources, justice and autonomy, that is to say: social spaces where violence grows easily. Also, the way she addresses right wing and left wing politics, like they were both ""partisanships"" to overcome, sounds a little bit off in my opinion.. Just recognizing the devastating effects of inequality is enough to put this Talk on the left espectrum. It is the right, not the left, that defends the big corporations and elites responsible for maintaining such devastating inequalities. Therefore, violence isn't just a problem of bad politics and people not caring enough, it is a problem of capitalism, because those things themselves are a problem of capitalism.",2,2020-02-05T02:52:10.000Z,0.0037874779541446297,neutral,thi is a veri good and compel ted talk violenc is a major social issu that ha to be treat and dealt with respons howev I do think some aspect of the talk were in need of further develop or were a littl mislead when she talk about inequ for exampl I think it alway import to remeb the big histor pictur of slaveri coloni imperi savag capit institut racism etc which enabl us to understand the inequ between countri that is to say countri the imperialist explor and margin the rest of the world creat social space depriv from resourc justic and autonomi that is to say social space where violenc grow easili also the way she address right wing and left wing polit like they were both partisanship to overcom sound a littl bit off in my opinion just recogn the devast effect of inequ is enough to put thi talk on the left espectrum It is the right not the left that defend the big corpor and elit respons for maintain such devast inequ therefor violenc is just a problem of bad polit and peopl not care enough it is a problem of capit becaus those thing themselv are a problem of capit ,"['veri', 'good', 'compel', 'ted', 'talk', 'violenc', 'major', 'social', 'issu', 'treat', 'dealt', 'respons', 'howev', 'I', 'think', 'aspect', 'talk', 'need', 'develop', 'littl', 'mislead', 'talk', 'inequ', 'exampl', 'I', 'think', 'alway', 'import', 'remeb', 'big', 'histor', 'pictur', 'slaveri', 'coloni', 'imperi', 'savag', 'capit', 'institut', 'racism', 'etc', 'enabl', 'us', 'understand', 'inequ', 'countri', 'say', 'countri', 'imperialist', 'explor', 'margin', 'rest', 'world', 'creat', 'social', 'space', 'depriv', 'resourc', 'justic', 'autonomi', 'say', 'social', 'space', 'violenc', 'grow', 'easili', 'way', 'address', 'right', 'wing', 'left', 'wing', 'polit', 'like', 'partisanship', 'overcom', 'sound', 'littl', 'bit', 'opinion', 'recogn', 'devast', 'effect', 'inequ', 'enough', 'put', 'talk', 'left', 'espectrum', 'It', 'right', 'left', 'defend', 'big', 'corpor', 'elit', 'respons', 'maintain', 'devast', 'inequ', 'therefor', 'violenc', 'problem', 'bad', 'polit', 'peopl', 'enough', 'problem', 'capit', 'becaus', 'thing', 'themselv', 'problem', 'capit']"
