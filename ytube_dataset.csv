Listen, dude, you're all over the place. You really need to focus better. Now, if you're talking about a simulation wouldn't the logical conclusion to such a video be to propose or write programs that could prove it and not talk about the ""simulated diseases along with us simulated humans"". Anyway, with this video you have proven nothing, it's just a bunch of hypothesis you took from elsewhere. I will just reiterate what I wrote while watching this video: 1) 3:17 Videogames getting better is an insufficient argument. Video games through machine learning which is using our own systems of understanding the world through our eyes if making the world look alike on the monitor to the one we see. That doesn't mean a simulation of reality is possible. Do you even realize how much computational power would have to be used to simulate every proton, electron, neutron of every atom in every molecule just so a teenager could look at her loserbook page and comment 'cool pie you're eating' which has no scientific relevance to anyone running the simulation whatsoever. It's just stupid to even think this is not reality. What point would everything have. Also, if it's a simulation it's bound to have bugs but the only bugs that exist are in brains, reality doesn't change, we forget things. Therefore you're projecting your imperfections onto the space around you by saying this is a simulation. It's not, the universe in your head is a simulation you made up. 2) 6:05 While this is interesting it doesn't mean a human watching and once you think about it, it makes perfect logical sense and it's a regular physics thing, just like a Doppler effect. It means that the quanta are so sensible to interference that when measuring them you emit so much energy that it impacts the system and you see a different result. Doesn't have a thing to do with this being a simulation. 3) 6:54 That was one of the stupidest and cringiest things I've ever seen, wtf was the point of that? What the fu?k does that even mean!?!?!?!? What are you talking about?! Use prepositions idiot.  With all of that being said, we're most probably not in a simulation. This is the real world.

To those that are confused about all the backlash the Manjaro team got over this, my video and all the community responses regarding this decision by Manjaro might seem like overreactions to those that are not invested in the politics of FOSS (or those not aware of such politics).  But so be it.  The Linux community called out these guys for pushing proprietary trialware, and the Linux community got them to change their minds.   The FOSS zealots (I include myself among them) did this not for ourselves but FOR ALL LINUX USERS, even those do not understand or agree with our position.  The moment we start allowing pre-installed proprietary trialware to become the norm, well...we might as well be running Windows then.  Thank you, Linux community!  And thank you, Manjaro team!

I think this situation could have been handled better, but the reaction to it was over the top and unwarranted.  I take particular offense at people calling proprietary software ""garbage"". I have been a developer on and off for decades. I have written proprietary software for clients. I work hard to keep my skills current and to produce the best program possible. My work isn't ""garbage"" because I am paid for it, or because you can't examine my code (not that any of you do), and FOSS is not superior because it is free. When a bug turns up in a proprietary program, it has to be fixed, and it has to be fixed NOW. If a bug turns up in a FOSS program, oh well. Maybe you'll be lucky and it will be fixed in the next release. Or maybe the bug will remain unfixed for years despite repeated reports and requests from users. Try running a business that way. This ""holier than thou"" attitude is bullshit.  I run MS Office in a Windows VM under Linux. I have certain documents set up to print a certain way. If I open those documents in Libre Office and print them, they do not look the same. The positioning is off. That's a problem. If this alternative office suite really works better than Libre Office for the things I need done, I will consider purchasing it, and I will be very appreciative to the Manjaro team for bringing it to my attention.

I have been using Manjaro and I really dislike WPS office.  Libre office isn't much better in my opinion.  I know some people will burn this post to the ground but in my opinion, if there was an office suite that was open source that was just like  Microsoft office but didn't have the Microsoft name, people would use it by choice.  I think some people are just anti-Microsoft and hate anything that shares any qualities of a Windows product.  I get that.  However, if something like this Free Office is available and it's very close to what I am used to, I'm going to give it a look.

For someone like me who had not opportunities to start at this field from serious background it's a good start. Now I'm in the middle of coursera course, but it all starts from some videos like yours and others. Everyone makes a mistakes, or being criticized by others, and it is unachievable goal to be perfect or doing things perfect and being loved by everyone. I'm sure 
those guys who criticized you, copied a lot from stackoverflow for their homework or paid projects for their own benefits, at least several times in their life, but nobody mentions that in their speech. It's not thy end of the world, unless you're doing really bad things, BUT most likely people are afraid to critisize the last one and choose softhearted and not dangerous for them guys to put them down and increase their own self-esteem this way.

However, I do think some aspects of the Talk were in need of further development or were a little misleading... When she talks about inequality, for example, I think it's always important to remeber the big historical picture of slavery, colonialism, imperialism, savage capitalism, institutional racism, etc, which enables us to understand the inequalities between countries, that is to say: ""first-world"" countries, the imperialists, exploring and marginalizing the rest of the world, creating social spaces deprived from resources, justice and autonomy, that is to say: social spaces where violence grows easily. Also, the way she addresses right wing and left wing politics, like they were both ""partisanships"" to overcome, sounds a little bit off in my opinion... Just recognizing the devastating effects of inequality is enough to put this Talk on the left espectrum. It is the right, not the left, that defends the big corporations and elites responsible for maintaining such devastating inequalities. Therefore, violence isn't just a problem of bad politics and people not caring enough, it is a problem of capitalism, because those things themselves are a problem of capitalism.",2,2020-02-05T02:52:10.000Z,0.0037874779541446297,neutral

The students who would otherwise play on their phones or read books or otherwise zone out were actively offering insights, asking questions, and trying new creative ways to solve whatever puzzle was posed. To make math fun and engaging, it doesn't need to be useful for our careers and I don't quite understand why, when I tell people I study math, they ask what I'm going to use it for or why I find it interesting.

It was supposed to recognize boxes, x's, sevens, simple shapes, and I defined the 7 or so neurons that I thought it might need by hand. I did all the weighted sums and sigmoid functions on paper with calculator in hand. It took maybe an hour and a half to get everything straight but once I did, it worked. It guessed with fairly good accuracy that the little seven I ""inputted"" was a little seven. All that excitement because of your video.  Later that evening and the next one, I tried to program the same function taking PNGs as inputs and definitions of the neurons and it honestly was only a little more rewarding. But now that I see what the hidden neurons *actually* look like, I only want to learn so much more. I expected the patterns to be messy, but I was really surprised to see that it really does almost look like just noise.  Thank you for making these videos. I find myself suddenly motivated to go back to calculus class tomorrow and  continue our less on gradients.

With the power of AI only limited by the processing speed of super computers far beyond the financial wealth of an individual or lesser human collective to control,  enslavement by a pernicious individual or collective, such as a global corporation, will be permanent and absolute.

All what we can do now is create a machine learning a specific thing like a video game or board game (not everything), and it's actually not magic. Just combining probability theories with smart algorithms to find patterns to solve a specific problems. Human is way more flexible and can learn anything. How far are we to create a machine that will learn anything like a human? so far. Far enough to actually wish and hope that will happen rather than fear it",160,2016-11-21T05:50:35.000Z,0.009663865546218484,neutral
